:black_heart::yellow_heart:Dear FC Kairat fans and not only,:black_heart::yellow_heart:

To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Almaty club and the fourth championship title in our history,
I developed a mobile app for FC Kairat. In this app, users can post on the forum, follow upcoming games, view standings and player statistics, 
purchase tickets, and support their favorite team. As an administrator, you can edit all the aforementioned data, create new players, and manage teams."

:black_heart::yellow_heart:Notes::black_heart::yellow_heart:

1) The app currently uses a local database, but there are plans to migrate to a remote database.
2) The app design will be improved.
3) A password recovery feature will be added.
4) User roles will be divided into administrators and regular users.
5) The ticket booking feature works by clicking the corresponding button in the game list, which redirects users to the website via a link.
6) Localization is partially implemented and will be further refined both technically and visually.

:black_heart::yellow_heart:Have fun by using and testing!:black_heart::yellow_heart:
